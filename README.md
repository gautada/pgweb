# pgweb

## Abstract

To make PostgreSQL administration more accessible and to make the overall usage easier this provides [pgwb](http://sosedoff.github.io/pgweb/) which is a web-based database browser for PostgreSQL, written in Go with zero-dependency binaries. **pgweb** was created as an attempt to build very simple and portable application to work with local or remote PostgreSQL databases.
